This plugin automatically enhances image links in WordPress to use Lightbox to display images and titles in an overlay.

== Description ==

Lightbox Plus is a plugin that implements Lightbox JS by Lokesh Dhakar.  Lightbox Plus is used to create overlay display images on the webpage and to automatically add the correct overlay links to images.  Lightbox Plus captures the image title for display.

Lightbox Plus uses WordPress's built in prototype and scriptacolous (builder and effect) libraries.

Not that is using the catption options build into WordPress the image title is generated by Ecit Image Title field and not the Edit Caption Field.  You can also manually add lightbox tags to your images sineg the following instructions from the Lightbox JS instructions.

1. Add a rel="lightbox" attribute to any link tag to activate the lightbox. For example:

        <a href="images/image-1.jpg" rel="lightbox" title="my caption">image #1</a>

Optional: Use the title attribute if you want to show a caption.

2. If you have a set of related images that you would like to group, follow step one but additionally include a group name between square brackets in the rel attribute. For example:

        <a href="images/image-1.jpg" rel="lightbox[roadtrip]">image #1</a>
        <a href="images/image-2.jpg" rel="lightbox[roadtrip]">image #2</a>
        <a href="images/image-3.jpg" rel="lightbox[roadtrip]">image #3</a>

Planned in next release:

1. Optional image title capture.
2. Class based implementation (I should have done it the first time around)
3. Suggestions welcome

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I use this plugin and Lightview Plus, Lightbox 2 (either one), WP lightbox JS Plugin at the same time? =

No they would interfere with the image enhancement in your posts and pages.

= Can I add my own styles and images for the overlay? =

Yes, you can add a new stylesheet to the css directory in the plugin directory.  Lightbox plus will show the stylesheet in the dropdown on the admin panel.  You can add your own images to the image directory but you will need to modify both the styles sheets and lightbox.js file to reflect the new images.
