Lightbox Plus permits users to view larger versions of images from the current page and display simple slide shows, all in an overlay.

== Description ==

Lightbox Plus implements ColorBox as a lightbox image overlay tool for WordPress.  <a href="http://colorpowered.com/colorbox/">ColorBox</a> was created by Jack Moore of Color Powered and is licensed under the <a href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php">MIT License</a>.  Lightbox Plus permits users to view larger versions of images without having to leave the current page, and is also able to display simple slide shows. The use of the dark or light background, which dims the page over which the image has been overlaid, also serves to highlight the image being viewed.  Lightbox Plus captures the image title for display in the overlay.

Lightbox Plus uses WordPress's built in jQuery library.

= IMPORTANT 1.5 UPGRADE INFORMATION =
See the change log for information regarding this upgrading to version 1.5 of Lightbox Plus.  There are significant differences from previous versions.

= Usage =

Note that getting the caption to appear in the overlay image by using the caption options built into WordPress Lightbox Plus uses the image title which is generated by "Edit Image Title" field and not the "Edit Caption Field."  You can also manually add lightbox tags to your images using the following instructions.

1. Add a rel="lightbox" attribute to any link tag to activate the lightbox. For example:

        <a href="images/image-1.jpg" rel="lightbox" title="my caption">image #1</a>

Optional: Use the title attribute if you want to show a caption.

2. If you have a set of related images that you would like to group, follow step one but additionally include a group name between square brackets in the rel attribute. For example:

        <a href="images/image-1.jpg" rel="lightbox[roadtrip]">image #1</a>
        <a href="images/image-2.jpg" rel="lightbox[roadtrip]">image #2</a>
        <a href="images/image-3.jpg" rel="lightbox[roadtrip]">image #3</a>

== Installation ==

1. Extract lightbox-plus.zip to your `wp-content/plugins` directory.
2. In the admin panel under plugins activate Lightbox Plus.
3. In the admin panel under Design/Appearance click on Lightbox Plus to configure to your taste.
4. It should now be completely set up and functional

= Upgrade Issues =
* 1.5.X upgrades are not always properly removing old styles, JavaScript  and image files
 * <em>Issue Fixed:</em> Well, mostly, as of version 1.5.2 the reset button will remove the old files <em>assuming</em> the permissions are set correctly.
* 1.5.X upgrades are sometimes failing
 * <em>Workaround:</em>Remove the plugin and install a new copy.  Use the reset button afterwards to remove old setting and instantiate new ones.

= Caveats =

Flash (i.e. YouTube videos, etc.) will sit atop the Lightbox Plus display not matter what the z-index is.  This is an issue with Flash.

See <a href="http://go.adobe.com/kb/ts_tn_15523_en-us">Flash content displays on top of all DHTML layers</a> at Adobe for details.

To work around this issue you will need to add something like the following to your <code>&lt;param /&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;embed&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;</code> tags:
<code>

        &lt;object&gt;&lt;param name="wmode" value="opaque" /&gt;&lt;embed wmode="opaque" [all other embed settings, file src etc.]&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;
</code>

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I use this plugin and Lightview Plus, Lightbox 2 (either one), WP lightbox JS Plugin at the same time? =

No other lightbox plugins can be used, they will most likely interfere with each other as they all modify the image URLs.  Other image overlay plugins may possibly be compatible.

= Can I add my own styles and images for the overlay? =

Yes, you can easily create additional styles by adding a new folder to the CSS directory under <code>wp-content/plugins/lightbox-plus/css/</code> by duplicating and modifying any of the existing theme folders or using them as examples to create your own.

= How does Lightbox Plus differ from other Lightbox plugins for WordPress? =

Performance wise the ColorBox jQuery plugin is smaller and generally faster than most lightbox JavaScript plugins.  The regular expressions that handle the text are more robust handling a wider variety of characters and in addition it will also grab the image title from the image to use for the overlay image caption.

= Lightbox Plus does not work correctly with WordPress' built-in gallery features, how do I make it work =

At present it does not.  WordPress' built in gallery has its own method for  dispaying image within WordPress' base framework. I am still working on an option that will allow Lightbox Plus to over ride this.  In the meantime of you would like to use Lightbox Plus with a gallery I suggest you try one of the many gallery plugins that support lightbox, NextGEN Gallery, Lazyest Gallery, or Inline Gallery for example.

= When reseting/re-initializing LBP the setting do not appear correctly when the page reloads, what gives? =

This problem is only apparent in Chrome and Opera.  It seems to works fine in Internet Explorer, Firefox and Safari.  There may be browser related issues and I am investigating the problem at this time.  For Chrome the settings are being saved but not displayed immediately, click on the Lightbox Plus link under appearance and you will see the current settings.  Opera for whatever reason is completely failing to save re-initialization settings, you must manually set and save them or use another browser.  And, no, it doesn't make sense since it's server side activity.
